### Hello world!
I am Arturo. I am a Biomedical Data Scientist :man_technologist:. I am passionate about improving people's medical diagnosis :stethoscope:, treatment :pill:, monitoring :test_tube:, rehabilitation :man_in_motorized_wheelchair:, and health :hospital: through the practical implementation of data-informed solutions using machine learning and artificial intelligence tools :mechanical_arm:.

### What am I up to now?
Currently, I am based in Eindhoven, The Netherlands :bike::cheese:. I am part of the Comprehensive Cancer Organization Netherlands (better known as [IKNL](https://iknl.nl/), for its Dutch name), where I am working as a Clinical Data Scientist. IKNL curates the Netherlands Cancer Register :open_file_folder:, a database containing (almost) all cancer incidences registered since 1989 :memo:. We use these valuable data to reduce the impact of cancer on Dutch patients :smile:. A few of the projects where I've been actively involved include:

* :blue_book: Federated Learning, where we generate global models using decentralized data, protecting the privacy :mag: of our patients' data. For this, we have developed our own infrastructure, [VANTAGE6](https://github.com/IKNL/vantage6).
* :green_book: Developing explainable ML/AI models :speech_balloon:, to bridge the gap between clinics and algorithms.
* :orange_book: Decision support, where we generate data-powered tools to help oncological clinicians and cancer patients when making important choices.

Whenever I have the opportunity (and time), I like contributing to open-source projects :open_book:. Lastly, I love learning new things :seedling:. I find joy in constantly updating my skills and toolset :hammer_and_wrench:.

### Free time
I enjoy running :running_man:, playing (Nintendo) videogames :video_game:, volleyball :volleyball:, and travelling :world_map:. Moreover, when for whatever reason I am not coding as part of my work, I like developing pop data science projects :clapper::space_invader:. Feel free to take a look at a few of my repos.
